Cap is an open-source software library for modeling energy storage devices.
To get started, [checkout the documentation](https://cap.readthedocs.org).

NEW - Escape dependency hell
----------------------------

No need to build Cap and its third-party libraries from source. Just pull the
latest image with Docker, run it, and launch numerical simualtions via your
web browser. PyCap makes it possible to create and manipulate Cap
``EnergyStorageDevice`` objects and execute algorithms (``Charge``,
``Discharge``, etc.) from an interactive Python command-line interpreter,
without the need to constantly recompile.
